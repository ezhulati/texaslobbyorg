Lobby Registration Fees
The Lobby registration fee is based on the type of clients that employ you to lobby.

Regular:  This registration classification applies if you are not eligible to register under the Non-Profit classification.  Most lobby registrants fit in this classification.  The regular annual registration fee is $750. 

Non-Profit:  You are able to register at this classification level only if ALL of your clients are organizations that qualify as exempt from federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), or 501(c)(6), or you are employed exclusively by such an organization.  The annual registration fee for qualified non-profit lobby registrants is $150. 

You must provide qualifying proof of tax exemption for your clients to the Texas Ethics Commission for verification in order to register at the Non-Profit level. This information can be one of:

IRS EIN number (found in the Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract (EO BMF) on the IRS website); or
Qualifying documentation for each of the clients not listed on the IRS website, verifying that the client is exempt from federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), or 501(c)(6). If you cannot provide such qualifying documentation for clients not listed on the IRS website, then you must register at the Regular level.
Lobby registration fees can be paid online with the filing application or they can be paid by cash or check delivered in-person or mailed to the Texas Ethics Commission. Online payments will include an additional non-refundable service fee. There is no service fee for payments hand-delivered or mailed to the Texas Ethics Commission. If you are delivering your payment to the Texas Ethics Commission, please print your invoice from the electronic filing system and include the invoice with your payment.
