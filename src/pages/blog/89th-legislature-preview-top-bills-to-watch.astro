      <!-- Introduction -->
      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none mb-16">
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The 89th Texas Legislature convenes January 14, 2025. Between now and sine die in late May, 181 legislators will file thousands of bills, hold hundreds of committee hearings, and make decisions that reshape entire industries.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Most businesses wait until mid-session to pay attention. By then, committee assignments are set, coalitions are formed, and the strategic positioning work that determines outcomes is already done.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Here's what you need to understand: legislative success isn't about having the best policy argument. It's about relationships with the right committee members, strategic timing on when to push your bill, and coalition dynamics that line up votes before hearings happen.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Let's break down the ten issue areas that will define this session—not just what the bills say, but who controls them, what the real dynamics are, and how smart business owners position themselves to influence outcomes.

            <p class="text-sm text-amber-800 mb-3">
              Governor Abbott and Lt. Governor Patrick are aligned on their top priorities for the first time in years. The Republican supermajority is secure. And the interim has been dominated by property tax and border security discussions.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-800 m-0">
              Translation: Leadership has the votes to move their agenda. If your issue conflicts with their priorities, you're playing defense. If it aligns, you have a narrow window to catch the momentum.

          <p class="text-texas-blue-700 font-medium">Why this determines everything else that happens this session</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Property tax reduction is the only issue both Governor Abbott and Lt. Governor Patrick have publicly declared a must-pass priority. That means it gets first-mover advantage on legislative bandwidth, consumes enormous political capital, and creates the fiscal constraint for every other spending bill.
          </p>

          <p>
            The surface-level debate is about caps on appraisal increases versus using state surplus to buy down local tax rates. The insider reality: this is about who gets credit (legislators or the Governor), which local governments take the revenue hit, and whether school finance reform gets bundled in or left for another day.

            <div class="text-sm text-blue-800 space-y-3">
              <p>
                <strong>Senate:</strong> Morgan LaMantia (D-South Padre Island) will likely chair the Senate Property Tax Committee. She's moderate, detail-oriented, and has relationships across the aisle. Watch her negotiations with Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston), the tax policy wonk who's been pushing appraisal caps for years.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>House:</strong> The Ways & Means Committee will handle the mechanics. Chairman still TBD as of this writing, but expect someone loyal to Speaker Phelan who can navigate the rural-urban divide on school funding impact.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                <strong>Real power center:</strong> The Governor's office and LG Patrick's staff will negotiate the framework before bills ever get filed. Committee chairs will implement that agreement, not design it from scratch.

            <div class="text-sm text-green-800 space-y-2">
              <p><strong>If you own commercial property:</strong> You're not the target of relief (homeowners are), so advocate for provisions that include commercial appraisal caps or at minimum don't shift more tax burden your direction.</p>
              <p><strong>If you depend on school funding:</strong> Tax compression using state dollars could mean more state control over local school budgets. Get positioned with the education committees early.</p>
              <p><strong>If you're in local government:</strong> You're taking a revenue hit either way. Your play is damage control—preserving local control and minimizing the cuts to essential services.</p>
              <p class="mb-0"><strong>Timing:</strong> This moves fast. Expect pre-filed bills in November, committee hearings by late January, and floor votes by March. Position yourself during the interim or you're too late.</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">The $5 Billion Border Security Question</h2>
          <p class="text-red-700 font-medium">Immigration enforcement expansion and the industries caught in the crossfire</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Texas has spent over $11 billion on Operation Lone Star since 2015. The 89th Legislature will allocate another $3-5 billion—but the money is the easy part. The real battles are over E-Verify mandates, employer penalties for hiring undocumented workers, and whether "sanctuary city" definitions get expanded to include any local government that doesn't fully cooperate with immigration enforcement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the dynamic most business owners miss: border security polling is popular across the political spectrum, which gives leadership cover to push aggressive enforcement measures. But the business community—especially construction, hospitality, and agriculture—relies on immigrant labor and quietly opposes measures that disrupt workforce access.
          </p>

          <p>
            This creates a strange coalition: Republican legislators supporting border "security" funding while privately working to kill provisions that penalize employers. Watch for provisions that sound tough in press releases but include enough carve-outs and enforcement discretion to be minimally disruptive in practice.
          </p>

          <div class="not-prose my-8 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-900 mb-3">The Players Who Matter</h3>
            <div class="text-sm text-blue-800 space-y-3">
              <p>
                <strong>Senate:</strong> Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa (D-McAllen) chairs Border Security. He represents the Valley, understands border economies, and will push back on measures that sound good in Dallas but devastate border communities. But he's working with a Republican majority that doesn't need his votes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>House:</strong> Homeland Security & Public Safety Committee handles this. Expect someone from a border district who can credibly claim expertise but is loyal enough to leadership to move their agenda.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                <strong>Behind the scenes:</strong> The Texas Border Coalition (mayors and county judges from border communities) has relationships built over decades. They can't stop border funding, but they can shape implementation to minimize economic disruption. If you're affected, align with them.
              </p>

            <div class="text-sm text-green-800 space-y-2">
              <p><strong>Construction companies:</strong> You can't publicly oppose border security, but you can advocate for workforce provisions, grace periods for E-Verify compliance, and safe harbors for good-faith verification efforts.</p>
              <p><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Push for H-2A visa program expansions as the alternative to enforcement-only approaches. Frame it as "legal pathway" rather than opposing enforcement.</p>
              <p><strong>Hospitality:</strong> Work through the Texas Restaurant Association and Hotel & Lodging Association. They have the political relationships to negotiate workable compliance timelines.</p>
              <p class="mb-0"><strong>Timing critical:</strong> E-Verify amendments get added in committee. If you're not at the table during markup, you won't have a seat for negotiations.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-amber-800 mb-0">
              Border security legislation <em>will</em> pass. The only question is how onerous the employer provisions are. Smart positioning now—building relationships with committee members, joining industry coalitions, and providing practical feedback on unintended consequences—shapes whether you face workable compliance requirements or business-killing penalties. Wait until the bill hits the floor and it's too late to influence the details that matter.

          <p class="text-orange-700 font-medium">Weatherization, market redesign, and the fight over who pays for reliability</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Winter Storm Uri killed over 200 people and cost Texas an estimated $130 billion in February 2021. Four years later, ERCOT reform is still unfinished business. The 89th Legislature will address weatherization mandates, backup power requirements, and fundamental electricity market redesign.
          </p>

          <p>
            The policy debate is complex: capacity markets versus energy-only markets, renewable integration, weatherization standards, demand response programs. But here's the real dynamic—every change to the electricity market creates winners and losers measured in billions of dollars.
          </p>

          <p>
            Natural gas generators want capacity payments (guaranteed revenue for being available). Renewable developers want transmission build-out and storage incentives. Industrial consumers want cheap power and don't want to subsidize residential reliability. And the Public Utility Commission, which regulates ERCOT, wants flexibility to implement changes without legislative micromanagement.
          </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>House State Affairs:</strong> This committee handles the big structural changes. Watch for technical amendments during markup—they look boring but shift billions in revenue between generators, transmission companies, and consumers.

          <p class="text-purple-700 font-medium">Education Savings Accounts, vouchers, and the rural revolt that's not dead yet</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Governor Abbott made school choice his signature issue. After multiple failed attempts, he spent the interim primarying Republicans who opposed vouchers—and won. But the fundamental tension remains: rural legislators fear Education Savings Accounts will devastate small-town school districts that serve as community anchors and major employers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The policy is straightforward—allow parents to use public dollars ($10,000-$12,000 per student) for private school tuition, homeschool expenses, or tutoring. But the politics are brutal. Private school advocates frame it as parental choice and educational freedom. Public school defenders frame it as defunding public education and abandoning rural communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the insider reality: Abbott has the votes in the Senate (Republicans are unified on this). The House is the problem. Even after primaries, enough rural Republicans remain uncomfortable that passage requires near-perfect attendance and potentially some Democratic support (unlikely).

              <p>
                <strong>The Governor's pressure:</strong> Abbott has made this the litmus test for his support. House members know he'll campaign against them if they vote no. That's enormous leverage.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Speaker Phelan's position:</strong> He supports school choice but has to manage his caucus. Expect him to negotiate sweeteners—per-pupil funding increases for public schools, teacher pay raises, facility funding—to bring rural members along.

              <p><strong>Private schools:</strong> You're winning but stay quiet. Let advocacy groups (Texas Public Policy Foundation, Texans for Educational Freedom) do the public fighting. Avoid looking like you're profiting from public dollars.</p>
              <p><strong>Charter school operators:</strong> You benefit from expanded choice but need to navigate relationships with traditional public schools. Position as "public school choice" rather than aligning fully with private school vouchers.</p>

              <p><strong>Public school districts:</strong> You can't stop this, but you can negotiate the terms. Push for revenue replacement, rural district protections, and accountability standards for private schools receiving public dollars.</p>

              If this makes it to the House floor, expect the longest debate of the session.

Each amendment is a negotiation point—and an opportunity for business owners affected by education policy to shape implementation details.

          <p class="text-green-700 font-medium">Medicaid expansion politics, rural hospital collapse, and telehealth's unfinished business</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Texas leads the nation in uninsured residents at 16.6% of the population. Democrats will file Medicaid expansion bills. Republicans will oppose them on ideological grounds. This script is as predictable as the sunrise.
          </p>

          <p>
            But beneath the expansion debate, real policy work is happening: rural hospital funding to prevent closures, Medicaid reimbursement rate increases to maintain provider networks, telehealth regulations that balance access and quality, and Certificate of Need reforms that determine who can open new healthcare facilities where.
          </p>

          <p>
            The dynamic to understand: rural Republican legislators represent communities losing hospitals. They can't support Medicaid expansion politically, but they desperately need solutions for healthcare access. This creates opportunities for targeted programs that thread the ideological needle—not "expansion" but "rural healthcare sustainability initiatives" or "provider network preservation funding."

          <p>
            Texas population is projected to double by 2050. Current water supplies can't support that growth. The 89th Legislature will allocate over $1 billion for new reservoirs, desalination plants, and conservation infrastructure.
          </p>

          <p>
            But water policy is where every Texas conflict converges: rural versus urban, agriculture versus development, surface water rights versus groundwater pumping, environmental protection versus economic growth. Battles over water are proxy wars for who controls Texas's future.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the dynamic to understand: every new reservoir requires 10+ years of planning, billions in bonding capacity, and political coalition-building across multiple legislative sessions. The real work is securing initial study funding and planning authorization. Construction funding comes later.

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Texas wants to be the destination for AI companies leaving California. But recent deepfake incidents, hiring algorithm discrimination claims, and concerns about AI in criminal justice have created political pressure to regulate before problems escalate.
          </p>

          <p>
            The challenge: most legislators don't understand AI beyond chatbots and deepfakes. That knowledge gap creates both opportunity (industry can shape reasonable regulation) and risk (poorly drafted bills that sound good but create unworkable compliance burdens).
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the dynamic to watch: California, Colorado, and the EU have passed AI regulations. Texas legislators will want to avoid being "behind" but also want to avoid California's regulatory approach that they view as anti-business. The sweet spot they're looking for: transparency and accountability requirements without innovation-killing restrictions.

              Expect aggressive deepfake regulation—criminal penalties for sexual deepfakes, political ad disclosure requirements, and platform liability for hosting non-consensual deepfakes. This has bipartisan support and will move fast. If your business creates, hosts, or distributes AI-generated content, you need clear labeling, takedown procedures, and age verification systems. The first high-profile incident during session will accelerate whatever bills are pending.

          <p class="text-emerald-700 font-medium">Eliminating barriers to entry without starting professional association wars</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Texas requires licenses for over 200 occupations. Reformers argue many licenses create barriers to entry without protecting public safety—do you need 1,500 hours of training to shampoo hair? Conservative and libertarian groups want to eliminate low-risk licenses and create universal recognition of out-of-state credentials.
          </p>

          <p>
            But every license has a professional association defending it. Cosmetology boards, auctioneers, landscape irrigators—they all have political relationships and argue their license protects consumers. Reforming these requires navigating political minefields where the policy case is clear but the lobbying resistance is organized.
          </p>

          <p>
            The strategic path forward: pick the lowest-hanging fruit (occupations with minimal public safety risk), grandfather existing license holders (they keep their credentials, just don't require them for new entrants), and phase implementation over multiple years. This minimizes opposition while achieving the policy goal.

                <strong>Opposition strategy:</strong> Professional associations will testify about consumer protection, safety risks, and economic harm to existing businesses.

              <p><strong>If your occupation is targeted for elimination:</strong> Don't fight to keep the license requirement—you'll lose and look anti-competitive. Instead, advocate for voluntary certification, industry self-regulation, or minimal competency standards. Frame it as protecting consumers while reducing barriers.</p>
              <p><strong>If you employ licensed workers:</strong> Support reciprocity for out-of-state licenses (expands your hiring pool) and streamlined application processes. You benefit from workforce flexibility.</p>
              <p><strong>Training programs and schools:</strong> Licensing requirements drive enrollment. If licenses are eliminated, pivot to voluntary certification programs, continuing education, and professional development. The demand for training doesn't disappear, it just becomes market-driven instead of mandatory.</p>
              <p class="mb-0"><strong>Professional associations:</strong> Your leverage is mobilizing members to contact legislators.

          <p class="text-violet-700 font-medium">Consumer rights, business obligations, and the fight over private right of action</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Texas is watching California's CCPA create compliance nightmares for businesses. Virginia and Colorado have passed more business-friendly alternatives. Texas will follow the Virginia/Colorado model—consumer data rights (access, deletion, opt-out) without California's aggressive enforcement and private right of action.
          </p>

          <p>
            The business community's position: we support reasonable privacy standards, but not California's approach that generates class-action lawsuits and forces businesses to hire compliance attorneys. Consumer advocates want stronger enforcement and penalties that actually deter violations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The likely compromise: consumer rights with state Attorney General enforcement (not private lawsuits), tiered requirements based on business size (small businesses get safe harbors), and 12-18 month implementation timeline to build compliance systems.

              <p>
                <strong>Senate Business & Commerce:</strong> Yes, Schwertner again. Data privacy fits his committee's jurisdiction and he's interested in balancing consumer protection and business flexibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>House:</strong> Could go to State Affairs or Business & Industry. Watch early bill filings to see who takes the lead.

              <p class="mb-0">
                <strong>Lobbying dynamic:</strong> Tech industry and retailers will push for Virginia-style law. Consumer groups will push for California-style enforcement. The business community will win this battle—question is how much consumer protection makes it into the final bill.

              <p><strong>E-commerce and retail:</strong> You collect tons of consumer data. Advocate for clear safe harbors, reasonable compliance timelines, and preemption of local ordinances (you can't comply with 50 different city privacy laws).</p>
              <p><strong>Tech companies and platforms:</strong> You're already complying with CCPA for California users. Support a Texas law that aligns with Virginia/Colorado so you can use existing compliance infrastructure. Push for federal preemption language.</p>
              <p><strong>Healthcare providers:</strong> HIPAA already regulates your data practices. Make sure the Texas law explicitly defers to HIPAA rather than creating conflicting requirements.</p>
              <p><strong>Financial services:</strong> Same as healthcare—GLBA and federal banking regulations already cover you. Coordinate with industry associations to preserve existing regulatory frameworks.</p>
              <p class="mb-0"><strong>Small businesses:</strong> Advocate for exemptions or simplified compliance for businesses under certain revenue/data volume thresholds. You can't afford enterprise compliance systems.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-red-800 mb-0">
              This is the make-or-break issue. Private right of action means consumers can sue for violations, creating class-action lawsuit exposure. Business will fight this to the death—and will likely win. Consumer advocates will push hard for it. The compromise might be limited private action for specific violations (like data breaches with proven harm) but not broad enforcement authority. Watch conference committee negotiations—this gets decided behind closed doors.

          <p class="text-slate-700 font-medium">Cash bail, retail theft, and the ideological divide that won't resolve</p>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Cash bail reform divides the Legislature like few other issues. Progressives argue it's a wealth-based detention system—poor defendants stay in jail awaiting trial while wealthy defendants go free. Conservatives argue eliminating cash bail releases dangerous criminals and increases crime.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both sides have data. Both sides have horror stories. And both sides have organized advocacy groups running campaigns. This makes compromise nearly impossible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The business angle: retailers are experiencing organized retail theft at scale. They want enhanced criminal penalties and prosecution resources. The bail reform debate intersects with this—if theft suspects are released without bail, retailers argue crime increases. Criminal justice advocates say cash bail doesn't affect organized crime (those operations post bail easily) and criminalizing poverty makes the problem worse.

              <p><strong>Criminal defense attorneys:</strong> You support bail reform but have limited political leverage. Partner with civil rights organizations and provide data on pretrial detention's economic costs to taxpayers (housing inmates awaiting trial).</p>
              <p><strong>Local governments:</strong> Jail costs are a huge budget item. Support alternatives to incarceration (monitoring, supervision) that reduce pretrial detention without eliminating bail. Frame as fiscal responsibility.</p>

        <!-- The Reality -->

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-amber-900 mb-2">The Reality of Legislative Timing</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-amber-800 mb-0">
            By mid-February, most of the strategic positioning that determines outcomes is already done. Committee chairs have their priorities. Coalitions are formed. Bill language is drafted. Amendments are prepared. You can still influence floor votes and conference committee negotiations, but the framework is set. Engage now or spend the session playing catch-up.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The 89th Texas Legislature will make decisions that reshape industries, create new compliance requirements, shift billions in spending, and determine which businesses thrive and which struggle for the next two years.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The bills I've outlined here aren't predictions—they're the priorities already being telegraphed by legislative leadership, the issues dominating interim hearings, and the coalitions forming right now. These fights are happening whether you engage or not.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The difference between businesses that succeed in this environment and those that get blindsided? Strategic positioning before session starts. Building relationships with committee members. Joining coalitions. Preparing data. Understanding the power dynamics that shape outcomes.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            You have eight weeks until session convenes. Use them wisely.
