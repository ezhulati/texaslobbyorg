                The 89th Texas Legislature convenes on Tuesday, January 14, 2025, for a 140-day regular session.
                Bills can be pre-filed starting November 11, 2024. This analysis is based on pre-filed legislation,
                interim committee recommendations, and public statements from legislative leadership.

          <p class="lead">
            Every two years, the Texas Legislature convenes in Austin for 140 days that can reshape industries,
            create new regulations, shift billions in spending, and determine which businesses win or lose.
            The 89th Legislature promises to be particularly consequential.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a Republican supermajority, renewed focus on border security and property tax relief, and
            hundreds of pre-filed bills already in the hopper, businesses that aren't paying attention will
            get caught flat-footed. Here are the ten bills and issue areas that deserve your immediate attention.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Property Tax Relief: The Legislature's Top Priority</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Property taxes have become politically radioactive in Texas.
          Governor Abbott and Lt. Governor Patrick have both declared property tax reduction a top priority.
          Expect significant legislation aimed at capping appraisal increases and providing homestead exemptions.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Appraisal caps:</strong> Proposals to limit annual property value increases to 5% or less
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Homestead exemption increases:</strong> Raising the exemption from $100,000 to $150,000+
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>School district M&O tax compression:</strong> Using state surplus to buy down local tax rates
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Real estate developers, property management companies, local governments,
          school districts, and any business owning commercial property.</p>

          <div class="not-prose bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 m-0">
              <strong>Legislative Intel:</strong> The House and Senate are aligned on the goal but may differ on
              the mechanism. Watch for tension between those wanting caps on appraisals versus those preferring
              to compress tax rates using state revenue.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>2. Border Security and Immigration Enforcement</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Texas has spent over $11 billion on border security operations since 2015.
          The 89th Legislature is expected to allocate another $3-5 billion for Operation Lone Star continuation,
          infrastructure, and enhanced enforcement measures.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Continued funding for DPS border operations</li>
            <li>Construction of new barriers and infrastructure</li>
            <li>E-Verify mandates for employers</li>
            <li>Penalties for employers hiring undocumented workers</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Construction companies, agriculture, hospitality, landscaping,
          and any industry relying on immigrant labor. Also: border communities, counties, and local governments.</p>

          <h2>3. Electric Grid Reliability and Energy Infrastructure</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Winter Storm Uri's 2021 blackout killed over 200 people and cost
          the Texas economy an estimated $130 billion. Grid reliability remains a live political issue,
          and ERCOT reforms continue.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weatherization requirements for power generation facilities</li>
            <li>Electricity market redesign proposals</li>
            <li>Backup power requirements for critical infrastructure</li>
            <li>Renewable energy transmission and interconnection rules</li>
            <li>Cryptocurrency mining regulations</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Energy producers, utilities, renewable developers, data centers,
          industrial manufacturers, and large electricity consumers.</p>

          <h2>4. Public Education Funding and School Choice</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Governor Abbott has made school choice his signature issue.
          After multiple failed attempts, he's expected to push hard for Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)
          or voucher programs that allow public money to follow students to private schools.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>ESA/voucher program proposals</li>
            <li>Per-pupil funding increases to sweeten the deal for rural districts</li>
            <li>Teacher pay raises</li>
            <li>Charter school expansion</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Public school districts, private schools, charter operators,
          education technology companies, and real estate developers in school-dependent communities.</p>

          <div class="not-prose bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm text-green-900 m-0">
              <strong>Political Context:</strong> This is the most divisive issue facing the Legislature.
              Rural Republicans traditionally opposed vouchers fearing damage to small-town schools.
              Abbott successfully primaried several anti-voucher incumbents, but resistance remains.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>5. Healthcare Access and Medicaid Expansion</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Texas leads the nation in uninsured residents (16.6% of the population).
          Medicaid expansion remains a Democratic priority but faces Republican opposition. Expect battles over
          reimbursement rates, provider networks, and rural hospital funding.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Medicaid expansion proposals (unlikely to pass but will be debated)</li>
            <li>Rural hospital funding and support programs</li>
            <li>Medicaid reimbursement rate increases</li>
            <li>Telehealth regulations and reimbursement</li>
            <li>Certificate of Need reforms</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, telehealth providers,
          pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare staffing agencies.</p>

          <h2>6. Water Infrastructure and Drought Preparedness</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Texas water supplies are strained by population growth and climate
          variability. The 2025 session is expected to allocate billions for new reservoirs, desalination,
          and water conservation infrastructure.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>$1B+ appropriation for new reservoir construction</li>
            <li>Desalination plant funding</li>
            <li>Groundwater conservation district reforms</li>
            <li>Agricultural water use regulations</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Agriculture, real estate developers, municipalities,
          water utilities, and construction companies.</p>

          <h2>7. Artificial Intelligence Regulation</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Texas wants to lead in AI innovation while preventing misuse.
          Expect first-of-their-kind regulations on AI transparency, bias, and use in criminal justice
          and hiring decisions.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>AI disclosure requirements for hiring algorithms</li>
            <li>Deepfake regulations and penalties</li>
            <li>Use of AI in law enforcement and courts</li>
            <li>Consumer data protection related to AI</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Tech companies, HR platforms, law enforcement, financial services,
          and any business using algorithmic decision-making.</p>

          <h2>8. Occupational Licensing Reform</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Texas requires licenses for hundreds of occupations, creating
          barriers to entry and limiting workforce flexibility. Reformers want to eliminate unnecessary
          licenses and create reciprocity with other states.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Elimination of low-risk occupation licenses (shampooers, auctioneers, etc.)</li>
            <li>Universal recognition of out-of-state licenses</li>
            <li>Reduction of continuing education requirements</li>
            <li>Online license application streamlining</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Professional associations, training programs, cosmetology schools,
          real estate, and construction trades.</p>

          <h2>9. Data Privacy and Consumer Protection</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Following California, Virginia, and Colorado, Texas is considering
          comprehensive data privacy legislation. Unlike California's stringent CCPA, Texas proposals tend to
          be more business-friendly but still create compliance obligations.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consumer data rights (access, deletion, opt-out)</li>
            <li>Business obligations for data collection and use</li>
            <li>Biometric data protections</li>
            <li>Children's online privacy</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> E-commerce, retail, social media, advertising, healthcare,
          and any business collecting customer data.</p>

          <h2>10. Criminal Justice Reform and Bail</h2>

          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Cash bail reform has divided the Legislature. Progressive activists
          push for eliminating cash bail, while conservatives argue it endangers public safety. The 89th session
          will likely revisit these debates.</p>

          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cash bail elimination or reform proposals</li>
            <li>Pretrial detention standards</li>
            <li>Bail bond industry regulations</li>
            <li>Criminal penalties for retail theft and organized crime</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Who's affected:</strong> Bail bond companies, retailers (concerned about theft),
          criminal defense attorneys, and local governments managing jails.</p>

          <h2>What Businesses Should Do Now</h2>

          <p>Don't wait until mid-session to engage. Here's your action plan:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Identify your priority bills.</strong> Which of these issues directly affect your operations?
              Track them using the <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-texas-blue-500 hover:underline">Texas Legislature Online</a> database.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Join industry coalitions.</strong> Trade associations amplify your voice. If your industry
              doesn't have coordinated representation, create it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build relationships now.</strong> Legislators are more receptive before session chaos begins.
              Schedule meetings in December and early January.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consider hiring a lobbyist.</strong> If the stakes are high, professional representation pays for itself.
              Browse <a href="/lobbyists" class="text-texas-blue-500 hover:underline">Texas lobbyists by expertise</a> on our directory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monitor committee assignments.</strong> Once committees are announced (usually late January),
              identify which chairs control your issues and focus efforts there.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>
            The 89th Legislature will address fundamental questions about Texas's future: How do we fix property taxes?
            How do we keep the lights on? How do we manage rapid growth while preserving what makes Texas attractive?
            The answers will create winners and losers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Businesses that engage early, build relationships, and make their case effectively will shape these
            outcomes. Those that ignore Austin until it's too late will be stuck with whatever passes.
          </p>
