          A client called last session asking about HB 3071. The caption said "Relating to property tax relief for small businesses." Sounds great for her retail stores, right? I told her to hire someone else because I don't lie to clients—that bill had nothing to do with property tax relief for her type of business. The actual text targeted a specific industrial classification with fewer than 200 businesses statewide. The title was misleading by design.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Bill captions lie. Not always, but often enough that reading only the title is worse than not reading anything at all. The difference between a business owner who can track bills and one who can't? About $5,000 per month during session—because when you know what to watch for, you know when you need professional help and when you don't.

            The Texas Legislature Online system at capitol.texas.gov is free, comprehensive, and updates in real-time during session. If you set it up correctly, you'll know about relevant bills before most legislators do.
          </p>

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                The MyTLO feature lets you save custom bill lists and set up email alerts. Without an account, you're manually checking the site daily. With it, the system notifies you when bills move.
              </p>
              <div class="bg-muted rounded-lg p-4">
                <p class="text-sm font-semibold mb-2">How to set it up:</p>
                <ul class="text-sm space-y-1 ml-4">
                  <li>• Go to capitol.texas.gov and click "MyTLO" in the top right</li>
                  <li>• Create free account with your email</li>
                  <li>• Verify email address (check spam if needed)</li>
                  <li>• Log in and you'll see "My Bill Lists" option</li>

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Alerts email you whenever a bill's status changes—filed, set for hearing, passed committee, etc. This is how lobbyists track 50+ bills without reading the website daily.
              </p>
              <div class="bg-green-50 rounded-lg p-4">
                <p class="text-sm text-green-900">
                  <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Set alerts to "Daily Digest" mode instead of immediate notifications. Otherwise you'll get flooded during session when bills move rapidly. One email per day with all updates is manageable.
                </p>

                Create separate lists for different priorities: "Must Kill," "Support," "Watch Only," "Industry Wide." When you're tracking 30 bills, organization prevents you from missing the critical ones.

            Experienced lobbyists read bill text last. We start with fiscal notes, bill analyses, and witness lists because these documents reveal who supports the bill, who opposes it, what it costs, and what problems the authors expect.

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                The Legislative Budget Board (LBB) analyzes every bill's cost to the state. Fiscal notes show whether a bill costs money, saves money, or has no fiscal impact—and they explain how the math works.
              </p>

                  <li>• Total cost to state over 5 years</li>
                  <li>• Which agencies get funding increases or cuts</li>
                  <li>• Where the money comes from (general revenue, fees, federal funds)</li>
                  <li>• Hidden costs like IT system changes or staffing increases</li>

                  <strong>Budget reality:</strong> Bills with $50 million price tags in tight budget years die in committee regardless of merit. Check the fiscal note early. If it shows massive unfunded costs, the bill is likely dead unless there's overwhelming political pressure.

        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Companion bills are identical (or nearly identical) legislation filed in both the House and Senate. One member files HB 500, another files SB 200 with the same text. This isn't duplication—it's strategy.
          </p>

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Both chambers can work simultaneously. While HB 500 moves through House committees, SB 200 moves through Senate committees. If both pass their chambers, you're done—no waiting for sequential passage.
              </p>
              <div class="bg-green-50 rounded-lg p-4">
                <p class="text-sm text-green-900">
                  <strong>Efficiency play:</strong> Companion bills cut weeks off the process. Instead of House→Senate sequential passage taking 100+ days, you can pass both chambers simultaneously in 60 days. This matters when sine die (day 140) is approaching.

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Capitol.texas.gov lists companions on each bill's page under "Companions." Sometimes they're labeled, sometimes you have to search by bill caption or text to find matching legislation.

                <p class="text-sm">
                  <strong>Search tip:</strong> Copy the bill's exact caption and search for it. If a companion exists, it'll have the same or very similar caption. Then compare bill text to confirm they're identical.

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Companion bills work best when both authors are committed, both committees are favorable, and the issue has bipartisan support. You're doubling your chances by having two paths forward.

                  <strong>Best case scenario:</strong> HB 500 passes House quickly. SB 200 passes Senate quickly. Both chambers receive identical bills. One chamber accepts the other's version. Done. No conference committee needed.

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                If one companion dies and the other passes, you're back to single-bill strategy. Worse, if both companions get amended differently, you've created extra work reconciling two different versions of the same bill.
              </p>
              <div class="bg-red-50 rounded-lg p-4">
                <p class="text-sm text-red-900">
                  <strong>Coordination failure:</strong> I've seen companion bills where House version got amended heavily and Senate version stayed clean. Then both passed their chambers with different text. Now you need a conference committee to reconcile bills that started identical. Companion strategy backfired.

              <strong>When tracking companions:</strong> Set alerts for BOTH bills. Track them separately. Don't assume they'll stay identical—committees can amend them differently. If amendments diverge significantly, the companion advantage disappears.

            Conference committees form when the House and Senate pass different versions of the same bill and neither will accept the other's version. Ten legislators—five from each chamber—negotiate a final version both sides can accept.

                Conference reports include three-column comparisons: House version, Senate version, and Conference Committee version. This shows you what each chamber wanted and what compromise they reached.

                  <li>• <strong>Column 1 (House):</strong> What House passed</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Column 2 (Senate):</strong> What Senate passed</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Column 3 (Conference):</strong> Final compromise language</li>

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                The ten members appointed to the committee control the final bill. Typically, leadership appoints members who support the bill. If you're trying to influence the outcome, these are the people to lobby.

                <p class="text-sm text-purple-900">
                  <strong>Lobbyist tactic:</strong> During conference negotiations, lobbyists work the ten members intensely. This is when amendments get added, provisions get removed, and compromises get struck. If you have concerns about the bill, conference committee is your last chance.

              <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Once the conference committee issues its report, both chambers vote on it without amendments. It's an up-or-down vote. Accept the compromise or kill the bill entirely.
              </p>

                <p class="text-sm text-red-900">
                  <strong>Strategic pressure:</strong> Late in session, conference committee reports create pressure to accept compromises. If members vote no, the bill dies and there's no time to restart negotiations. This leverage forces acceptance of provisions members might otherwise oppose.

                Emergency clauses require 2/3 majority in both chambers. That's 100 House votes and 21 Senate votes. If a bill threatening your business has an emergency clause, it might die on the vote count alone—2/3 is hard to achieve.

            <p class="text-sm text-purple-900">
              <strong>My advice:</strong> Learn to track bills yourself. When you see one that's moving fast, has strong sponsor support, and would materially harm your business—that's when you call a professional. Use TexasLobby.org's search filters to find lobbyists who specialize in your industry and have relationships with the relevant committees.

              Business owners who track legislation themselves make better decisions about when to hire lobbyists, which bills to worry about, and where to focus limited advocacy budgets. The skills I've outlined here—setting up tracking systems, reading bill text, understanding status changes, and analyzing fiscal notes—are tools lobbyists use daily.
            </p>

            <p>
              You won't catch everything. Committee staff conversations, behind-the-scenes negotiations, and political dynamics require insider relationships only lobbyists have. But you'll catch 80% of what matters, and you'll know when that remaining 20% requires professional help.
            </p>

            <p>
              The difference between reactive business owners and strategic ones? Reactive owners hire lobbyists in a panic when bills are about to pass. Strategic owners track bills early, engage when timing is optimal, and save money by knowing which battles require professionals and which don't.
            </p>

            <p>
              Start tracking legislation that affects your industry. Build the habit during interim when bill volume is low. By the time session starts and 7,000 bills get filed, you'll know the system, recognize the patterns, and make smart decisions under pressure.
