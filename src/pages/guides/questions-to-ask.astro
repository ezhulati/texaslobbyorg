        If you're like most executives I talk to, you're hiring your first lobbyist the same way you hire other professionals—asking for referrals and picking someone with good reviews. That works for accountants. It fails for lobbyists.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Every veteran lobbyist knows this truth: the difference between a mediocre lobbyist and an exceptional one isn't their website, their LinkedIn profile, or even their client list.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          It's the relationships they've built with committee staff you'll never meet. The trust they've established with agency officials over years, not months. The text messages they get on Sunday nights when committee schedules shift.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          You won't discover any of that from a résumé. You need to ask the right questions—and know what good answers actually sound like.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 1 -->
      <section id="question-1" class="mb-16 scroll-mt-8">

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">1. What specific committee staff relationships do you have relevant to my issue?</h2>
          <p class="text-texas-blue-700 font-medium">Why this matters</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Committee staff—not legislators—write the actual bill language, draft amendments, and control hearing schedules. A lobbyist without staff relationships is like a contractor without tools.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="font-semibold text-texas-blue-700 mb-3">What a good answer sounds like:</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              "I've worked with Sarah on the House Public Health Committee staff for six years. We collaborated on three different healthcare bills last session. I also have a strong relationship with the committee clerk—she texts me when hearing schedules change."
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "I know all the committee chairs" or "I have great relationships at the Capitol." (Too vague—they're avoiding specifics because they don't have them.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Look for specific names, specific committees, and specific examples of working together. Generic claims about "Capitol connections" mean nothing.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Question 2 -->

        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Track record matters—but only if it's relevant to your specific needs. A lobbyist with 20 years of energy policy experience will struggle with a healthcare bill if they don't have the right committee relationships.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">

              "Last session, I worked with a manufacturing client facing similar permitting challenges. We positioned the issue during interim hearings, built a coalition with three other trade groups, and got HB 1847 through committee with a 7-2 vote. The key was briefing staff six months before session started."
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "I've passed dozens of bills" or "I can't discuss client work due to confidentiality." (Either they're exaggerating or they're hiding a weak track record.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Listen for specificity: bill numbers, committee votes, timeline, strategy. Vague claims about "legislative success" typically mask limited actual wins.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <section id="question-3" class="mb-16 scroll-mt-8">

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">3. What do you do during the interim (the 18 months between legislative sessions)?</h2>
          <p class="text-texas-blue-700 font-medium">Why this matters</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            The Texas Legislature only meets for 140 days every two years. Most successful legislation is positioned during the interim, not during session. If your lobbyist goes dark between sessions, you're already behind.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="font-semibold text-texas-blue-700 mb-3">What a good answer sounds like:</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              "I attend relevant interim committee hearings, monitor agency rulemaking that affects clients, maintain relationships through quarterly staff briefings, and pre-file client bills in November before the January session starts. I send monthly updates during the interim."
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "We ramp up when session starts" or "I stay in touch with key contacts." (Translation: they're not doing the relationship-building that wins require.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Effective lobbyists work year-round. The 140-day session is just the execution phase of an 18-month strategy.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- Question 4 -->
      <section id="question-4" class="mb-16 scroll-mt-8">

          <p class="text-texas-blue-700 font-medium">Why this matters</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Your lobbyist works for you, not the other way around. You should know exactly what's happening, when it's happening, and why it matters to your business.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="font-semibold text-texas-blue-700 mb-3">What a good answer sounds like:</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              "Weekly email updates during session with bill status, committee activity, and upcoming deadlines. Monthly check-ins during the interim. Immediate calls for urgent developments or when I need your input on strategy decisions. You'll also get access to our client portal with real-time bill tracking."
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "I'll keep you informed as needed" or "You can call me anytime." (This means you'll be chasing them for updates, which is backwards.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Establish clear communication protocols upfront. The best client-lobbyist relationships are partnerships with predictable, proactive communication.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- Question 5 -->
      <section id="question-5" class="mb-16 scroll-mt-8">

          <p class="text-texas-blue-700 font-medium">Why this matters</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            You need your lobbyist fully committed to your position. If they're simultaneously representing a client with opposing interests, your advocacy gets compromised.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="font-semibold text-texas-blue-700 mb-3">What a good answer sounds like:</p>

              "I don't currently represent anyone in your sector. I screen all potential clients for conflicts before engagement. If a conflict emerges during representation, I have a policy of [specific resolution approach]."
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "I represent many clients, but I keep everyone's interests separate" or avoiding the question entirely. (If they won't disclose potential conflicts upfront, walk away.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Ask directly about their current client roster and request disclosure of any potential conflicts. Transparency here is non-negotiable.
          </p>

      <!-- Question 6 -->
      <section id="question-6" class="mb-16 scroll-mt-8">

          <p class="text-texas-blue-700 font-medium">Why this matters</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Lobbying fees vary widely—from $5,000 to $25,000+ per month during session. You need to understand exactly what services you're getting for that investment.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="font-semibold text-texas-blue-700 mb-3">What a good answer sounds like:</p>

That includes bill tracking, committee testimony, staff briefings, coalition coordination, and weekly reporting. Travel to your facility for site visits is additional at cost. Here's a detailed scope of work document."
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "My fee depends on the scope" without providing specific numbers or deliverables. (Vagueness about money usually means you'll pay more for less.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Get fee structures in writing with clear deliverables. You're not just paying for meetings with legislators—you're paying for years of relationship-building, strategic positioning, and Capitol access.
          </p>

          <p class="text-texas-blue-700 font-medium">Why this matters</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Track records matter, but client testimonials reveal just as much—especially about communication style, responsiveness, and results delivery.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="font-semibold text-texas-blue-700 mb-3">What a good answer sounds like:</p>

              "I can connect you with three references: a healthcare nonprofit, a manufacturing company, and a trade association—all had similar regulatory challenges. I'll send their contact info today, and they've agreed to speak with prospective clients."
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "All my clients are confidential" or providing only one generic reference. (Established lobbyists should easily provide 3+ relevant references.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            When you speak with references, ask about communication frequency, strategic guidance quality, and whether they'd hire the lobbyist again. Those answers tell you everything.

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Legislative success isn't always about passing a bill. Sometimes it's killing bad legislation, amending harmful provisions, or positioning for the next session. You need clear success metrics upfront.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">

            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "We'll know success when we see it" or only measuring by bills passed. (The latter ignores defensive work and long-term positioning.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Establish measurable goals at the start. Your lobbyist should be able to articulate exactly what winning looks like for your specific situation.

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Effective advocacy requires bipartisan relationships. The Texas Legislature has Republican majorities, but you still need Democratic support for many bills—and future political landscapes shift.

              "I've worked with members from both parties throughout my career. I have strong relationships with Chairman Smith (R) and Vice-Chair Rodriguez (D) on the Business & Industry Committee. I focus on policy, not politics—which helps me build trust across the aisle."

            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "I only work with Republicans" or "I'm more connected on the Democratic side." (Partisan lobbyists limit your options and risk your issue becoming political when it shouldn't be.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Look for lobbyists who emphasize process and policy over partisan politics. The best advocates have credibility with both sides because they've built it over years.

              "If the bill doesn't advance, we have three options: 1) Attach it as an amendment to another vehicle bill, 2) Work through the appropriations process if funding is involved, 3) Build stronger coalition support during the interim and come back stronger next session. The worst outcome is not failure—it's failing without learning what went wrong."
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Red flag answer:</p>
            <p>
              "We'll make sure it passes" or "That won't happen." (Overconfidence is a huge red flag—legislative outcomes are never guaranteed.)

            Strategic lobbyists plan for multiple scenarios. If they can't articulate a Plan B and Plan C, they're either inexperienced or not thinking strategically enough.

            <p>
              Here's the reality: these questions don't just help you evaluate lobbyists. They reveal whether a lobbyist understands how the Texas Legislature actually works.
            </p>

            <p>
              A mediocre lobbyist will give you vague answers about "Capitol connections" and "legislative experience." An exceptional lobbyist will provide specific examples, specific names, and specific strategies—because they've done the work.
            </p>

            <p>
              The difference between the two? It's the same difference between having a meeting with a legislator and actually influencing legislation. One is window dressing. The other is what wins require.
